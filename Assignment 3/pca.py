# input: datamatrix as loaded by numpy.loadtxt('dataset.txt')
# output:  1) the eigenvalues in a vector (numpy array) in descending order
#          2) the unit eigenvectors in a matrix (numpy array) with each column being an eigenvector (in the same order as its associated eigenvalue)
#
# note: make sure the order of the eigenvalues (the projected variance) is decreasing, and the eigenvectors have the same order as their associated eigenvalues
